To address this, we can add a nil check before using `self.myObject`:

```objectivec
@implementation MyDelegate
- (void)myProtocolMethod:(MyObject *)object {
  if (self.myObject) {
    [self.myObject doSomething];
  }
}
@end
```

Alternatively, consider using a block-based approach for communication to avoid these risks.  Using blocks ensures that the object is valid during execution:

```objectivec
@interface MyObject()
- (void)performActionWithCompletion:(void (^)(BOOL success))completion;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)performActionWithCompletion:(void (^)(BOOL success))completion {
  // ... Perform action ...
  completion(YES); //or NO on failure
}
@end

@implementation MyDelegate
- (void)myProtocolMethod:(MyObject *)object {
    [object performActionWithCompletion:^(BOOL success) {
        //Handle success or failure here
    }];
}
@end
```
This makes the code more robust and less prone to crashes caused by unexpected object deallocation.
